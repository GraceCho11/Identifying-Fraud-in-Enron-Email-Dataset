# Identifying-Fraud-in-Enron-Email-Dataset
Enron was one of the major American energy companies based originally in Houston, Texas in which by 2002, had completely collapsed into bankruptcy as a result of audit failure and corporate fraud. The purpose of this study was to apply machine learning as a method to build a person of interest identifier based on the Enron dataset which is a dictionary combined from the Enron financial and email data. In this study, the decision tree, Naive Bayes, and Stratified Shuffle Split algorithms were implemented and tested for accuracy. 

# Example Screenshot of the Identifying Fraud in Enron Email Dataset Project 

The screenshot is the PCA plot for the Salary and Bonus. 0.98928806 and 0.01071194 are our eigenvalues that resulted from the PCA plot. The red in the plot is the direction of the first principal component and the cyane is the direction of the second principal component. We see that the red line is a better fit to our data.
